   <center><E><b>Our food truck, founded by two Muslim brothers in the north of Melbourne, is a symbol of unity and compassion for our brothers and sisters in Islam and beyond. We are dedicated to serving our community with meals made from locally sourced ingredients that are 100% Halal certified. With a commitment to giving back, half of our profits are allocated to support our brothers and sisters in need in Palestine, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and other regions around the world.

    Our mission goes beyond just providing delicious meals; 
    we aim to make a positive impact by contributing to those less fortunate in our global community. By supporting us, you are not only enjoying high-quality and accessible food but also helping us empower and uplift those facing hardships.
    
    
    At our food truck, we believe that everyone deserves access to nutritious and flavorful food, 
    regardless of background or circumstance. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive space where all are welcomed to enjoy our offerings. Join us in our mission to spread love, kindness, and generosity through the power of food.</b></E></center>
